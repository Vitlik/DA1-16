#'
#' Starts the steps for finding outliers.
#'
#' Outliers are observation which fall off far from other observations and they bias the results of
#' different analyses tool.
#'
#' There are different reasons for the ocurrance of outliersï¼šThey simply occur as contigencies or
#' they occur because of technical errors, such as measurement error of sensor or errors on the harddrive.
#' Another important source of outliers is that those outliers might actually belong to another
#' undersampled distribution, which is not discovered.
#' Eliminating outliers generated from the undersampled distribution can disturb the attempt to recover
#' the real distributions while deleting outliers caused by technical errors is legitimate.
#' Unfortunately these cannot always be distinguished and therefore need to be treated carefully.
#'
#' Two functions are executed here:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item \code{\link{d.b.outlier_detection}}
#'   \item \code{\link{d.c.outlier_delete}}
#' }

  # The function "lofactor" identifies outliers by calculating the multivariate distances.
